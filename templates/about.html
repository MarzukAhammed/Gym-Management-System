        <h5>Founder & Visionary</h5>
        <p>
          Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Marjuk Ahmed</strong>, the founder of this gym.  
          Born on <strong>May 10, 2000</strong>, I come from a family where 
          discipline, hard work, and dedication have always been a priority.  
          Along with my passion for fitness, I am also a <strong>CSE graduate from Bangladesh</strong>, 
          pursuing advanced studies abroad while working towards my dream of blending 
          <strong>technology and fitness</strong> together.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a <strong>white-hat hacker</strong>, a technology enthusiast, and a dreamer 
          who believes in self-improvement every single day. My vision is not only 
          to build a premium gym environment but also to create a space where people 
          can improve both their <strong>body and mindset</strong>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I strongly believe in the philosophy:  
          <em>‚ÄúSuccess is built by consistent small steps every day.‚Äù</em>  
          This gym is a reflection of that mindset. With modern facilities, 
          expert trainers, and a community that motivates each other, 
          we are building more than just muscles ‚Äî we are building confidence and discipline for life.
        </p>
